### Project Summary/Abstract

For many years, addictions researchers have asked research subjects "what has motivated you to do drugs in the past month," however, other research has shown that most individuals can't remember or don't actually know the motivations behind certain behaviors. When somebody is asked to explain why they did something in the distant past, or something that had an ambiguous cause, many people fail to give an accurate answer. This validation study evaluates how well these retrospective blanket statements actually map on to daily reports of the same behaviors. We find that the widely used questionnaires for measuring motivations behind drinking and cannabis use to not map on well to daily questionnaires about the same behavior, which are closer to the ground truth. 

The files in this folder illustrate the full project:

	- **coping_motives_eval.r**: This is the core data analysis script, including the code for EDA, modeling, and final outputs. The data is not included in this folder structure
	- **Correlations Matrix - Coping Motives.pdf**: this Visualization showcases the correlations between all validation variables in the study. Some insights can be drawn from this graph alone, but full insights are derived from final model outputs
	- **Literature Review Visualization.png**: To determine the previous statistical support for these measures, I have created this visualization showcasing the direction and strength of associations the variable of interest has with other measures it should have high correlations with.
	- **sensitivity analysis**: This script contains synthetically generated data and a hard-coded sensitivity analysis to determine how much power the available had to find significant effects for our proposed models. The results from this analysis show that non-significant findings in the full study are likely representative of a faulty mapping between our measure of interest and our validation measure.
	- **Pre-registration**: This contains the methodology and proposed analyses of the study. A manuscript draft of the full study with results is available upon request

### Professional Use Cases

This study directly showcases my ability to evalaute KPIs and the status quo measures/features in established organizations (in this case, quantitative addictions research). When evaluating why a machine learning algorithm is failing in its predictions, often times the data itself is the issue. If our systems for generating data or engineering features is faulty then all steps following will suffer and predictions will lack in performance. This study represents my ability to critically think through and improve the data quality of even highly established measures in a rigorous setting, which can readily be applied to predictive algorithms or to evaluate the quality of data dashboards.
