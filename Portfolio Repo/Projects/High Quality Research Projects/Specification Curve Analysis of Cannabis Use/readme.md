### Project Summary/Abstract

Much of addictions research tells us that our emotions impact our addictive behaviors. However, researchers disagree on the specifics of this claim. When we say negative emotions lead someone to drink or smoke cannabis, do we mean the person's sadness, anger, irritability, something else, or a combination of many things? Do they impact someones likelihood to start drinking, or the number of drinks they have? Specification curve analysis is a way that we can measure all the possible specifications of these to find the combinations that fit. This study accomplishes a missing piece in addictions research, which holistically looks at all specifications in the same graphs and metrics.

### Professional Use Cases

The uses of Specification curve analysis are countless. This is a new technique that can be applied to both scientific and industry research. Many times researchers will disagree on the perfect way to measure a feature, and many times these different specifications are valid. In this case, we can establish generalizability of an idea by evaluating the impact of all possible specifications and see just how well these measures actually estimate the outcome. If you want to evaluate employee or client sentiment, but are unsure of the best way of doing so, you can try all possible combinations of the available data predicting an individuals sentiment and see what the general picture shows.
