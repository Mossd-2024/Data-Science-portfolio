### Project Summary/Abstract


Research suggests that people use alcohol and cannabis to manage negative emotions, but daily life studies show that negative emotions don't always lead to substance use (Dora, Piccirillo, et al., 2022b; Dora, Smith, et al., 2022).

Traditional views are limited, assuming people only turn to substances after feeling bad. Newer models see emotion regulation as a process, involving identifying emotions and choosing how to manage them. Substance use may only help when people believe they need to change their feelings or lack other ways to cope (Cooper, 1994).

This (accepted and soon to be published) study will explore this broader approach, focusing on how people assess their emotions and the strategies they use to manage them, aiming to better understand when and why substance use happens.


#### This folder contains the following files (Coding script will come soon):

	- **Registered Report Manuscript.doc**: This is the accepted manuscript for the study. At its current stage, it is a registered report, similar to a proposal, but has been accepted for publishing once results are found.
	- **codebook - ER RR.pdf**: This is the data codebook. This codebook was developed by me and showcases in detail the research methodology and available data used in the study. 



### Professional Use Cases

My role in this study was to assist in writing the manuscript, specifying the statistical models, and managing the data collection, data storage, and codebook development. This study showcases rigorous data management, data documentation, and research/statistical techniques that can be used in a plethora of industry use cases. The current methodology imputes missing data using leading-edge statistical techniques and proposes models that estimate behavioral outcomes from emotions. In industry settings, this can be used in conjunction with crude measures of emotions such as from sentiment analysis of social media data, or user data. Digital markers and other passive data can also be used as proxies for certain emotions as predictors for behavioral outcomes of interest to industry leaders.

Additionally, I was responsible for management of the longitudinal data collection, which calls for a need for robust sampling and data quality validation. This is not detailed heavily in the manuscript, but for examples of this, see the codebook in this folder.
