### Project Summary/Abstract

The goal of this study is to test the degree to which passive smartphone data can be used to predict retrospective reports of alcohol use behaviors (using Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test) both prior to and four months following a period of passive mobile sensing. This folder contains the below files:

	- **Pre-Analysis Report.pdf**: This report is our pre-registration, meaning that we are establishing our hypothesis and criteria for conclusions before we run our analysis, as to avoid overstating or cherry-picking our findings. The report details the full analytical plan, the data generation methodology, and the expected outputs upon which we will determine our conclusions.
	- **PR Code.r**: This R script contains the proposed analyses. The code is partly truncated and much is meant as a placeholder while the data is being processed for the full analysis. However, the script provides the appropriate code as a proof-of-concept for the proposed analyses.


### Professional Use Cases

The modern world is ripe with data from digital sources, but many data scientists struggle to build insights from raw digital data or derive features that are important for predicting certain outcomes. The prospective insights of typical data such as consumer information (e.g. website traffic) is useful, however, there is immense potential in processing and deriving insights from raw user data such as from smartphone sensors or other passively collected data. This project showcases experience in building predictive models and deriving insights from this passive data. Organizations with this data can utilize insights to improve user experience, or drive consumer behavior.
