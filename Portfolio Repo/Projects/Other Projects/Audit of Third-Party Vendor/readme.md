### Project Summary/Abstract

This is an actual report developed by me to evaluate a third-party service used by my research lab to determine if we should continue using the vendor to deliver SMS messages to clients (published with permission but with some redacted information). Using vendor provided data on our purchases and client-side data (link clicks, received SMS, etc), I created this report out of concerns our clients weren't receiving all SMS messages. I determined that we were not getting our expected dues and summarized key findings to bring to our team. Using this report we decided to switch to another vendor, and our metrics have improved drastically.

### Professional Use Cases

Evaluating vendor data is paramount to many business models and research endeavors alike. Being able to compare internal with external metrics and measure the impact on KPIs is an essential part of any organization. This evaluation shows an ability to inspect vendor data and evaluate their actual value to the organization.
