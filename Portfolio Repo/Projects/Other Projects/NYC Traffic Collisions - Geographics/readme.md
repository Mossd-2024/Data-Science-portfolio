### Project Summary/Abstract

This student research project evaluates preliminary patterns in NYC traffic collisions to provide to city planners and civil engineers with possible causes to non-random accidents. The report derives information on traffic collisions from NYC boroughs, zipcodes, vehicle characteristics and contributing factors to collisions. Additionally, descriptive statistics were gathered to investigate relationships between income with collision outcomes at the zipcode level. Preliminary results suggest future research directions that could uncover latent causes for traffic collisions, and provide geographic maps showcasing collision hot spots for the use of city planners and NYC civil engineers.

The files in this folder include:

	- **Analytical Report.pdf**: The final report for the project
	- **Are Accidents Really Accidents.pptx**: The slide deck for the project
	- **nyc_acc_notebook.ipynb**: The notebook containing all the analysis

### Professional Use Cases

Geographical data can be highly useful for business cases, particularly when gathering insights on users form multiple locations or insights on brick-and-mortar store locations. The ability visualize this data and provide understandable summary statistics for actual decision-makers (city-planners, in this case).
