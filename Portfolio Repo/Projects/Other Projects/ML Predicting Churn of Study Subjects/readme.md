### Project Summary/Abstract

This project uses research subject data to predict cases in which participants will not complete a follow-up survey. Using a machine learning framework, I fit multiple specifications for multiple models and use the model to predict the churn of participants for the following month. The predictive performance was above base rates and the deployment of the model with interventions did lead to reductions in churn. That said, more robust methods (e.g. boosting, neural nets, etc) were not attempted, and although the best performing models used nested data, the final model had not accounted for this structure. Despite this, my model had accomplished the intended goal and led to organizational gains.

### Professional Use Cases

Churn is a concern for any business model that relies on consistent customers, which is common in many industries. This project showcases an applied example of developing a predictive model for the purposes of intervening on individuals who are likely to churn. I have many more ideas for how to improve and investigate subject churn such as predicting and aggregating along multiple time dimensions (day, week, month), and predicting complete churn or returning client churn. Additionally, this project showcases I can develop presentation slides that lead to changes in procedures that lead to actionable results (i.e. interventions that actually reduced churn).
